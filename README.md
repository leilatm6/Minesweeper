# MinesweeperI develped this program for minesweeper game. There are 8 bombs in the screen that should be found
how to play:
open squares with the left click and put flags on mines with the right click. Double right click  changes your flag into a closed square. When you open a square that does not touch any mines, it will be empty and the adjacent squares will automatically open in all directions until reaching squares that contain numbers. A common strategy for starting game is to randomly click until you get a big opening with lots of numbers.

To reset the game click on the happy(sad) face at top of the screen
